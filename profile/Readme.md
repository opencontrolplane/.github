Welcome to OpenCP</h3>

OpenCP (Open Control Plane) is an open source project originally developed by [Civo](www.civo.com) to provide a single interface to manage infrastructure across providers using a single tool, `kubectl`.

OpenCP is built on top of the existing best practices of kubectl and kubeapi and is released as open source under the Apache 2 license. It will always be open source, free, and available to all clouds, big or small.

Our end goal is for an OpenCP user to not have to host or run OpenCP themselves, with endpoints natively provided by the cloud service provider of their choice.

## Learn about OpenCP

The [OpenCP documentation repository](https://github.com/opencontrolplane/documentation) is the best place to learn about the project and its aims.
